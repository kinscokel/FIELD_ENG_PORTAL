# Field Engineer Resource Portal

This is my django REST FRAMEWORK web application for tech engineers to create and update various works and also share ideas. This app has some few features as it is not near completion yet, features like admin task, date of project created, updated etc. Other features will be added as project undergoes completion. So as regards to the project buildup, this week i added up sum technical features like the User permission in the permission.py file and also the views for User and Task.
